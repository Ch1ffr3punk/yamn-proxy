yp.exe (yamn-proxy) is a  wrapper for yamn.exe, which 
allows  you  to  send   anonymous  emails  or  Usenet 
postings, through the Tor  Network and then with long 
latency trough the YAMN  remailer network. yp.exe ist 
best used with  NymVPN, to hide Tor  network usage at 
home.                                                 

Simply download yp.exe and yamn.exe from the Releases 
page and  put both  files in  a 'yamn'  folder. Prior 
using  yp.exe start  tor.exe with  the standard  port 
9050.  

As of August 22nd 2025 the source code for yamn-proxy
is updated to support configuration files.

If in  the same directory of yp and yamn is  no  file
found yp will use the internal default values.

To send an anonymous email:

cd into  your 'yamn' folder and  start notepad.exe to 
write your anonymous email, which may look like this: 

To: alice@example.org
Subject: Hello Bob              

Hi Bob,

this is my first test message with yp.exe.

Best regards
Alice.                                   

Save it as msg.txt

Then run under cmd.exe:

yp -refresh

which will update  the public keys and  stats for the 
YAMN remailers.                                       

To send your message with only one remailer:

yp -m -S -l dirge < msg.txt

This  will create  a  pool folder  for the  encrypted 
payload which then will be send to the dirge remailer 
through the Tor  network. The email to  Bob will then 
arrive a little later.                                

To  use  multiple  hops  (up to  ten)  you  can chain
remailers:

yp -m -S -l dirge,yamn,frell < msg.txt

To send an  anonymous message to a  Usenet Group your 
message may look like this:                           

To: mail2news@dizum.com
Subject: Test
Newsgroups: alt.test.test                                         

Hello World! :-)

To reply to a Usenet Posting  you have to look at the 
Message:-ID string  and a reply would  then look like 
this:                                                 

To: mail2news@dizum.com

As you see, yp.exe with  Tor and optionally NymVPN is 
an easy  and secure way  to send anonymous  emails or 
Usenet postings, with longer latency.                 

If you like yp.exe as much  as I do, consider a small
